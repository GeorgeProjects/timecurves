# timecurves

Time curves are a visualization for temporal data, explained in detail here: www.aviz.fr/~bbach/timecurves. 

The code for time curves is divided into a client and a server. The client front end is written in java scrpt and relies on d3. The backend, is written in Java and calculates the curves which are then visualized by the client side. Those files have the extension curve and are in json format. 

Currently, the repo contains the client side. The server side calculating curves for wikipedia articles, videos, and dynamic networks comes soon.
